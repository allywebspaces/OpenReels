Current checkpoint (16 October 2026): first autonomous execution has implemented a separate visual-only candidate and pinned English source/props/approved-video checks. Reuses approved AAC via stream copy and verifies audio hash. New source/type/policy checks passed; GitHub Free visual experiment job will render on this branch. Local render failed twice at os.networkInterfaces; no more identical retries. Next: verify remote render, inspect actual clue/question boundary frames and archive candidate. Baseline unchanged; no paid inference or public posting. See PROJECT_STATE.json and VISUAL_EXPERIMENT_RUN.md.

Facts live in `project.jsonl`, a Git-backed knowledge graph. Every observation needs a date and source. Live source files and user corrections override stale memory. No match means unknown, not permission to guess. The wrapper caps each response at 6,000 UTF-8 bytes and reports omitted entities; refine the query if any are omitted. This is an output-size budget, not an exact tokenizer count or measured savings.

Memory is useful only when read and maintained. It cannot enlarge the model context window, guarantee recall or eliminate hallucinations. This project store is not global ChatGPT memory and is not a backup of all user conversations.
