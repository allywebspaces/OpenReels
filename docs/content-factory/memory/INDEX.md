# Project memory — read this first

Goal: establish original English micro-drama shorts first; user selected this focus on 14 October 2026.

| Entity | Retrieve when |
|---|---|
| OpenReels | Repository, branch and delegation scope |
| EnglishOnly | Script, captions or asset policy |
| FreeFirst | Rendering, provider or spending decisions |
| ApprovedVoice | Speech and review media |
| PilotEvidence | Prior renders and verification limits |
| NextMilestone | Current task and immediate next action |
| MicroDramaFocus | First-channel choice, format and episode |

Current checkpoint (16 October 2026): user authorized autonomous routine decisions and continuation. Read AUTOPILOT.md and PROJECT_STATE.json. Hourly Advance OpenReels build task configured; first scheduled execution is not yet verified and no next-run timestamp returned. Focused review of three approved stills/timeline completed in CURRENT_EPISODE_REVIEW.md. Next: separate controlled visual alternative preserving approved script/audio. No new render this turn. Keep free-first/English-only and preserved baseline; no channel creation, public posting or paid inference. GitHub is the durable state; local worktrees may be absent.

Retrieve a small slice:

```bash
npm ci --prefix tools/agent-memory --ignore-scripts
node tools/agent-memory/memory.mjs open ApprovedVoice

Facts live in `project.jsonl`, a Git-backed knowledge graph. Every observation needs a date and source. Live source files and user corrections override stale memory. No match means unknown, not permission to guess. The wrapper caps each response at 6,000 UTF-8 bytes and reports omitted entities; refine the query if any are omitted. This is an output-size budget, not an exact tokenizer count or measured savings.

Memory is useful only when read and maintained. It cannot enlarge the model context window, guarantee recall or eliminate hallucinations. This project store is not global ChatGPT memory and is not a backup of all user conversations.
